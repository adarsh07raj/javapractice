# Java DSA Practice Journey

This repository documents my journey in learning Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) using Java. It contains a collection of practice programs covering fundamental concepts, from basic arithmetic operations to control structures and loops.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following directories for better navigation:

- **arithmetic/**: Programs demonstrating basic arithmetic operations.
  - `subtraction.java`: Example of subtraction operation.

- **conditions/**: Programs illustrating conditional statements and decision-making.
  - `condition_elseif.java`: Example using if-else if conditions.
  - `ifElse_condition.java`: Basic if-else structure.

- **io/**: Programs related to input and output operations.
  - (Currently empty, but intended for I/O examples like `input.java`)

- **loops/**: Programs showcasing different types of loops.
  - `while_loop.java`: Demonstration of a while loop.

- **main/**: Main class files or entry points for the programs.
  - (Currently empty, but intended for `Main.java`)

- **practice/**: Miscellaneous practice files and experiments.
  - `practrice2.java`: General practice code (note: filename has a typo).

## Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed (version 8 or higher recommended).
- A Java IDE or text editor (e.g., VS Code with Java extensions).

## How to Run

1. Navigate to the project directory: `d:\javapractice`
2. Compile the Java file: `javac <filename>.java`
3. Run the program: `java <classname>`

For example, to run the while loop program:
```
javac loops/while_loop.java
java -cp . while_loop
```

Note: Some programs may require compilation in a specific directory or with classpath adjustments depending on dependencies.

## Learning Goals

This project serves as a personal log of my progress in:
- Understanding basic Java syntax
- Implementing fundamental algorithms
- Practicing problem-solving with code
- Building a foundation for advanced DSA topics
